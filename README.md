# OSFEM (Optimisation Scripts for Empirical Models)

Not for finite element method, sorry.

Please note that this repository does not contain extensible or generalised code.

Everything is pretty much spaghetti'ed up to get quick results just for me.

If you want to use a more general optimisation Python wrapper, please head to:
